# History

Cryptography, and security more generally, has historically been tied to conflict and war.
Militaries have developed techniques for communicating securely on the battlefield.
Below are some early examples of cryptography and information security.

## Ciphers

Ciphers are algorithms for performing encryption and decryption.
Early ciphers can be computed with just pen and paper (or papyrus).

### Scytale

A scytale[^1] is a transposition cipher.
To encrypt a message, you would wind a strip of parchment around a cylinder, writing length-wise.
The recipient would be able to decrypt the message by winding the the strip of parchment around a cylinder of equal diameter.
